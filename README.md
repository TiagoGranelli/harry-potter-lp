# Harry Potter LP

Welcome to the Harry Potter LP project!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

- **Live Preview**: [harry-potter-d1u0s5x4y-tiagogranelli.vercel.app](https://harry-potter-d1u0s5x4y-tiagogranelli.vercel.app/)
- **API Source**: [hp-api.onrender.com](https://hp-api.onrender.com/)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js version 18

## Setup & Running

1. **Installation**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This will install all the necessary dependencies.

2. **Development Mode**:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will run the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes. You might also see lint errors in the console.

3. **Building for Production**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   This command builds the app for production in the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for performance. The build will be minified, and the filenames will include hashes. Once done, your app will be ready for deployment!
